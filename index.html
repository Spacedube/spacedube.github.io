        <h3>Weed</h3>
        <p>Marijuana is a drug we use marijuana for a stimulant this drug is also used for getting high no arousing when we get high we use our brain muscle to relax and enjoy.</p>
        <p>There's a way to get more high by using cannabis we can solve that we use our oil to make us high this is a ongoing problem with the police they dont want to see people high these people do our best to make cannabis legal when we smoke cannabis we get high.</p>
        <p>
          Marijuana doesn't cost much we can buy marijuana at low price its the oil that's expensive cause of the extraction method we can buy more drugs but marijuana is better then all when do we get our marijuana ready that's when our time has come to smoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weed session doesn't make us high its the process that we make weed makes us high when we take a huge amount that's how we get high and tap in spiritual world and realm.
