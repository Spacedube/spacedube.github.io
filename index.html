        <h3>Weed</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>Marijuana is a drug we use marijuana for a stimulant this drug is also used for getting high no arousing when we get high we use our brain muscle to relax and enjoy.</p>
        <details><summary>...</summary>
          <p>There's a way to get more high by using cannabis we can solve that we use our oil to make us high this is a ongoing problem with the police they dont want to see people high these people do our best to make cannabis legal when we smoke cannabis we get high.</p>
        <p>
          Marijuana doesn't cost much we can buy marijuana at low price its the oil that's expensive cause of the extraction method we can buy more drugs but marijuana is better then all when do we get our marijuana ready that's when our time has come to smoke.
        </p>
        <p>
          The weed session doesn't make us high its the process that we make weed makes us high when we take a huge amount that's how we get high and tap in spiritual world and realm.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we're high we know the spiritual realm is real we then contact these spirit's these people dont have there body that means there out of order to contact a spirit you need to be high when your high we can dismantle thing's we dont want to dismantle human beings cause there more precious then any other race.
        </p>
        <p>
          When we're high we can tap into ghost realm this when the body has left no soul in there we talk to a ghost BOO! You not scared then why is it there camera capturing you right now with a ghost in it we can make more images on Google this were you find most of there images now when your high you get scared of ghost's not spirit others it's opposite 
        </p>
        <p>
          You where on your phone when you met Zion then what happened you had to talk to a true rastafarian to dicuss which way is it to leave home so you can go out of your way to leave earth home what would you use your rastafarian power for.
        </p>
        <p>
          The league we have more options like a selection of weed we like you to choose out of four find the best that suits you. We want you to hand over your rastafarian status from Jamaica to Africa to legalize weed there that's how our country will have true democracy. There are other ways to be come legal in africa like when you smoke pot at home at your own pace makes peace that you are doing it in private in closed place. There are other ways to smoke and get high like on the beach were there's sand and water you get a nice jade feeling that there are people there.

        <h3>When we plant</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
          When we plant weed we make sure we have sun for one month the plant has three stages baby medium and fertilization we can plant two and one plant becomes male and one plant becomes female when we plant more we get different variety how do we know is that when the plants are there is there mix there pollen.
        </p>
        <details><summary>...</summary><p>
          What happens when we mix our plant pollen the plant gets more powerful when we add drops of water to the pot the water dissolves the pollen and forms equator around the flowering making it more potent.
